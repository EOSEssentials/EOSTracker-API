Execute this command to install the project:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:EOSEssentials/EOSTracker-API.git
$ cd EOSTracker-API
$ composer install
```

ðŸ“Œ Usage
-----

There's no need to configure anything to run the application. Just execute this
command to run the built-in web server and access the application in your
browser at <http://localhost:8000>:

```

Alternatively, you can [configure a fully-featured web server][2] like Nginx
or Apache to run the application.
