📌 Installing Composer
------------

Composer is the dependency manager used by modern PHP applications and it can also be used to create new applications.

Download the installer from [getcomposer.org/download](https://getcomposer.org/download/), execute it and follow the instructions.


📌 Installation
------------

Execute this command to install the project:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:EOSEssentials/EOSTracker-API.git
$ cd EOSTracker-API
$ composer install
```

📌 Usage
-----

There's no need to configure anything to run the application. Just execute this
command to run the built-in web server and access the application in your
browser at <http://localhost:8000>:

```

Alternatively, you can [configure a fully-featured web server][2] like Nginx
or Apache to run the application.
